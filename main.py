# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
print(2*2)
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it

# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`

# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable


# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "  lenIfgth of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
length=15 
width=20
area=length*width
print(f"the result is{area}")
print(f"if the length of rectangle is {length},and width is {width} then the area is:{area}")
